<p>
    <b>Rust</b> is a general-purpose programming language emphasizing performance,
    type safety, and concurrency. 
    It enforces memory safety, meaning that all references point to valid memory.
</p>
    
<p>
    It does so without a traditional garbage collector;
    instead, memory safety errors and data races are prevented by the "borrow checker", 
    which tracks the object lifetime of references at compile time.
